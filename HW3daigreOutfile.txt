This program simulates a game where the player randomly moves around a triangular game board. The player can move in four directions: up left, up right, down right, down left. Whenever the player moves to a new position on the board the player markes that positon with a dot. The game ends when all positions have been marked. As the program runs, the game prints the current position. When the game completes, the program prints some stats about the game that just concluded.
